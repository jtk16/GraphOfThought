# **Project Plan: Self-Adapting Graph-of-Thought Language Model**

This document outlines the long-term plan and context for this project.

## **1. Core Concepts & Goal**

The primary goal is to implement a novel AI paradigm by combining two advanced concepts:

*   **KV-Cache Thought Graphs (KVTG):** As described in `Thought_Graphs.tex`, this is the core reasoning architecture. Instead of linear chain-of-thought, the model will build a graph where each node represents an immutable "thought" (a snapshot of the LLM's KV-cache). This allows for parallel exploration, backtracking, and sophisticated merging of different reasoning paths.
*   **SEAL (Self-Adapting Language Model):** As described in `LLM Advancements_ Deep Dive Analysis_.md`, this is the learning and adaptation mechanism. When the KVTG successfully solves a problem, the correct reasoning path (a subgraph) will be used as a high-quality, self-generated training example to fine-tune the model's own weights.

The final product will be a language model that can reason through complex problems by building a thought graph and learn from its successes to improve itself over time.

## **2. Hardware Context & Model Selection**

*   **Environment:** Google Colab with an L4 or A100 GPU.
*   **Implications:** This is a powerful single-GPU setup, but it has memory constraints. The KVTG architecture, with its parallel node expansion, can be memory-intensive. The base model must be carefully chosen to leave enough VRAM for the graph, KV-cache snapshots, and the SEAL training process.
*   **Base Model Choice:** A model in the ~7 billion parameter range is the ideal starting point.
    *   **Primary Candidate:** **Mistral-7B-Instruct** (or a successor). It offers an excellent performance-to-size ratio, strong base reasoning, and is well-supported in the ecosystem.
    *   **Contingency:** If memory becomes a major issue, we could consider even smaller models or explore quantization techniques (like GGUF/AWQ) for the base model, though this may impact reasoning fidelity.

## **3. Project Structure**

A modular structure will be used to separate concerns.

## **4. Data Strategy**

1.  **Base Training Datasets:**
    *   **Primary:** **GSM8K (Grade School Math 8K)** for its high-quality, multi-step reasoning paths.
    *   **Secondary:** **OpenOrca-Step-by-step-reasoning** or the **CoT Collection** to add diversity.
2.  **Data Processing:** A script (`src/data_processing/preprocess.py`) will convert the linear step-by-step solutions from these datasets into a graph format to be used as "golden" reference paths.
3.  **SEAL Data Source:** The same datasets will provide the *problems*. The model's goal is to rediscover the solution path via the KVTG, which then becomes a self-generated training example for the SEAL fine-tuning loop.

## **5. Training & Development Pipeline**

1.  **Phase 1: Setup & Foundational Model.**
    *   Initialize the project structure.
    *   Select and load the pre-trained base model (e.g., Mistral-7B-Instruct).
2.  **Phase 2: Initial Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).**
    *   Implement the data preprocessing script.
    *   Run `train_base.py` to fine-tune the model on the "golden" graph paths. This teaches the model the basic structure of graph-based reasoning.
3.  **Phase 3: KVTG+SEAL Self-Improvement Loop.**
    *   Implement the core KVTG and SEAL logic.
    *   Implement `train_seal.py` to run the main training loop: Explore with KVTG -> Evaluate solution -> Fine-tune with SEAL on success.
